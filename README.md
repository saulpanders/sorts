# sorts
Practice implementing various sorting algorithms in python. Includes a random value generator to be used to test certain sorts. Also included are several examples for the program's expected input.

## sorts.py
Implements the following sorting algorithms:
* bubble sort
* insertion sort
* merge sort
* quicksort (in place)
* quicksort (recursive)
* selection sort
* heap sort
* counting sort
* radix sort
* bogosort
* cycle sort

TODO: implement file IO & command line arguments

## generator.py
Generates a list of random, non-negative integers and writes it to a file for later sorting.
